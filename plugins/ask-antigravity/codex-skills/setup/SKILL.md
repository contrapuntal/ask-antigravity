# Antigravity setup

## Execution contract

- Find the absolute path of this installed `SKILL.md`. The plugin root is two directories above its containing skill directory: `<plugin-root>/codex-skills/<skill>/SKILL.md`. Resolve the companion at `<plugin-root>/scripts/antigravity-companion.mjs`. Never depend on the source checkout, the current working directory, or `ANTIGRAVITY_CLI_PLUGIN_CC_ROOT` to locate it.
- Run `node` with the resolved companion path using Codex's shell execution tool (`exec_command`), with the target repository as `workdir`. Require only Node.js 18.18+ to run setup. Run it even when agy is missing, unsupported, or not authenticated so the companion can diagnose that state.
- This release supports foreground execution only. Consume `--wait` as a foreground routing flag. If the user requests `--background`, report that background execution is unsupported and do not start a foreground substitute. Do not use shell `&`, `nohup`, Claude `Bash`/`Agent`, or background-notification instructions.
- If execution returns a session ID, keep polling that same session with `write_stdin` until it exits. Use waits of at most 60 seconds and give concise progress updates during long calls. A session ID is still an active foreground call, not a completed result. On cancellation, signal the running companion through the host's process controls; on POSIX, receiving SIGINT/SIGTERM makes it terminate the active agy process group and clean temporary files.
- Treat arguments as data. Prefer a tool accepting an argument array when available. For shell strings, single-quote each argument and replace embedded single quotes with the standard shell sequence `\'` outside the quoted spans (for example, `a'b` becomes `'a'\''b'`). JSON stringification is not shell escaping. Never interpolate raw user text, evaluate it, or use unquoted shell substitutions. Preserve base references and model display names exactly, including spaces.
- Respect Codex's configured network, filesystem, and approval policy. If blocked, explain the specific missing access and stop; do not automatically retry with broader permissions or edit global permissions. agy needs outbound service access. Recorded macOS headless startup also needed localhost socket binding and log writes under `~/.gemini/antigravity-cli/`; session state, crash output, and OAuth refresh may need additional writes in that tree. Do not assume an API key or log redirection removes these requirements. Do not print credentials or run installers/sign-in automatically.
- Preserve Antigravity's response and report a nonzero exit or empty-response diagnostic as failure. Do not invent results, hide failures, or automatically retry a failed model call.

## Setup check

Invoke the companion's `setup` command. Ordinary setup checks local installation, supported version, and authentication evidence; it does not verify a usable session and makes no model request.

Pass `--json` when requested. Only pass `--live` when the user explicitly requests a live/connectivity check; this sends a minimal model request from a temporary working directory and can incur usage. `setup --live --json` reports `live.ok` and `live.detail` separately from the authentication heuristic; a failed probe exits nonzero.

Report the detected installation/version and whether authentication is merely inferred or verified live. Explain missing CLI/authentication or host permission diagnostics without changing settings. A populated configuration directory alone is not proof of working authentication.

The live probe uses a 90-second agy print timeout and a two-minute hard limit. In JSON, `authenticated` and `auth_method` remain local heuristic evidence for compatibility. With `--live`, use `live.ok` and `ready` as the verified outcome; `authenticated: false` with `live.ok: true` means the local probe missed valid credentials, not that authentication failed.
