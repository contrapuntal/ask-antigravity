# Antigravity review

## Execution contract

- Find the absolute path of this installed `SKILL.md`. The plugin root is two directories above its containing skill directory: `<plugin-root>/codex-skills/<skill>/SKILL.md`. Resolve the companion at `<plugin-root>/scripts/antigravity-companion.mjs`. Never depend on the source checkout, the current working directory, or `ANTIGRAVITY_CLI_PLUGIN_CC_ROOT` to locate it.
- Run `node` with the resolved companion path using Codex's shell execution tool (`exec_command`), with the target repository as `workdir`. Require Node.js 18.18+ and an installed, authenticated `agy` 1.1.15+.
- This release supports foreground execution only. Consume `--wait` as a foreground routing flag. If the user requests `--background`, report that background execution is unsupported and do not start a foreground substitute. Do not use shell `&`, `nohup`, Claude `Bash`/`Agent`, or background-notification instructions.
- If execution returns a session ID, keep polling that same session with `write_stdin` until it exits. Use waits of at most 60 seconds and give concise progress updates during long calls. A session ID is still an active foreground call, not a completed result. On cancellation, signal the running companion through the host's process controls; on POSIX, receiving SIGINT/SIGTERM makes it terminate the active agy process group and clean temporary files.
- Treat arguments as data. Prefer a tool accepting an argument array when available. For shell strings, single-quote each argument and replace embedded single quotes with the standard shell sequence `\'` outside the quoted spans (for example, `a'b` becomes `'a'\''b'`). JSON stringification is not shell escaping. Never interpolate raw user text, evaluate it, or use unquoted shell substitutions. Preserve base references and model display names exactly, including spaces.
- Respect Codex's configured network, filesystem, and approval policy. If blocked, explain the specific missing access and stop; do not automatically retry with broader permissions or edit global permissions. agy needs outbound service access. Recorded macOS headless startup also needed localhost socket binding and log writes under `~/.gemini/antigravity-cli/`; session state, crash output, and OAuth refresh may need additional writes in that tree. Do not assume an API key or log redirection removes these requirements. Do not print credentials or run installers/sign-in automatically.
- Preserve Antigravity's response and report a nonzero exit or empty-response diagnostic as failure. Do not invent results, hide failures, or automatically retry a failed model call.

## Standard review

Invoke the companion's `review` command. Forward an explicit `--base <ref>` for a branch comparison and `--model <display name>` when requested. Otherwise keep the dispatcher's existing target selection and selected agy model. Do not add `--write` or free-form focus text; use adversarial-review for a directed design challenge.

The dispatcher collects the Git diff and includes it in a review prompt. agy runs in a temporary working directory. This expresses review intent; changing directories is not filesystem isolation. Host filesystem policy provides any enforced restrictions.

Return the severity-organized Markdown result faithfully. If there are no changes, report the companion's no-changes result.
