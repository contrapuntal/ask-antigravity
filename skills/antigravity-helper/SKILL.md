# antigravity-helper

This skill lets any Anthropic-Skill-aware agent (Codex CLI, OpenCode, Pi.dev, plus Claude Code via `.claude/skills/`) delegate to the Antigravity CLI (`agy`) for code review and task analysis. It wraps the `ask-antigravity` companion script — a stateless Node.js dispatcher that assembles the prompt, writes it to a temp workspace directory, expresses analysis or write intent, runs `agy` in print mode, and extracts the marker-wrapped response so agy's tool-use narration never reaches the user.

> If you are running inside Claude Code, prefer the slash-command surface (`/ask-antigravity:review`, `/ask-antigravity:adversarial-review`, `/ask-antigravity:rescue`, `/ask-antigravity:setup`) provided by the ask-antigravity plugin. For Codex, prefer the native `ask-antigravity` plugin and its four Codex skills, which resolve the installed companion without an environment variable. This skill remains the portable fallback.

## Prerequisites

- **`agy` CLI 1.1.15+ for reviews; 1.0.7+ for task/setup, installed and authenticated.** Install with `curl -fsSL https://antigravity.google/cli/install.sh | bash` or `brew install --cask antigravity-cli` (agy is not distributed via npm). Older agy hangs in headless print mode; the companion refuses to invoke it and asks for an upgrade. Sign in by running `agy` interactively and completing Google sign-in, or set `ANTIGRAVITY_API_KEY` in the environment.
- **`node` 18.18 or later** on PATH.
- **`ANTIGRAVITY_CLI_PLUGIN_CC_ROOT` env var** pointing at the absolute path of the cloned `ask-antigravity` repository. If that variable is unset, ask the user for the path before running the companion.
- **Workspace trust.** If `agy` has not been interactively trusted in the directory you invoke it from, trust the workspace in agy (it records `trustedWorkspaces` in its `settings.json`). Without trust, headless `agy` may refuse to proceed.

## When to invoke this skill

Trigger on requests that match any of:

- "review my changes / diff / branch with Antigravity"
- "challenge this design choice / pressure-test this implementation"
- "ask Antigravity to investigate / analyze / fix X"
- "give me a second opinion on…" (especially when the question benefits from a large-context single pass)

Do **not** trigger when the user only wants Claude's own review or when the task is small enough that delegation adds latency without value.

## Invocations

All commands assume the working directory is the repo being reviewed/analyzed.

### Code review (diff-based, structured markdown output)

```bash
node "$ANTIGRAVITY_CLI_PLUGIN_CC_ROOT/plugins/ask-antigravity/scripts/antigravity-companion.mjs" review

node "$ANTIGRAVITY_CLI_PLUGIN_CC_ROOT/plugins/ask-antigravity/scripts/antigravity-companion.mjs" review --base main
```

The output is markdown with a fixed skeleton: `## Summary` then `### Critical / High / Medium / Nits` sections. Stream it back to the user verbatim.

### Adversarial review (diff-based, steerable, accepts focus text)

```bash
node "$ANTIGRAVITY_CLI_PLUGIN_CC_ROOT/plugins/ask-antigravity/scripts/antigravity-companion.mjs" adversarial-review "look for race conditions in the retry path"
```

Same output shape; framing is "find reasons this should not ship" rather than general review.

### Delegate a task / second opinion

```bash
# Default: Antigravity analyzes and proposes. NOTE: this is not a sandbox — agy may
# still edit files (see "Not a guaranteed sandbox" below). Run on a clean git tree.
node "$ANTIGRAVITY_CLI_PLUGIN_CC_ROOT/plugins/ask-antigravity/scripts/antigravity-companion.mjs" task "investigate why the build is failing in CI"

# Write intent: passes --dangerously-skip-permissions so agy won't stall on prompts.
node "$ANTIGRAVITY_CLI_PLUGIN_CC_ROOT/plugins/ask-antigravity/scripts/antigravity-companion.mjs" task --write "fix the failing test with the smallest safe patch"
```

Prefer `--prompt-file <path>` over inline text when the task text is untrusted or contains shell metacharacters: it carries the text as data instead of on a shell command line.

### Setup probe (local install + authentication evidence)

```bash
node "$ANTIGRAVITY_CLI_PLUGIN_CC_ROOT/plugins/ask-antigravity/scripts/antigravity-companion.mjs" setup
node "$ANTIGRAVITY_CLI_PLUGIN_CC_ROOT/plugins/ask-antigravity/scripts/antigravity-companion.mjs" setup --json
```

Ordinary setup does not verify a working authenticated session. For an explicitly requested connectivity check, add `--live` (also supports `--json`); this makes a minimal model call and may incur usage. The JSON live result is reported in `live.ok` and `live.detail`, separately from the authentication heuristic, and a failed live check exits nonzero.

agy needs outbound service access. Recorded macOS headless startup also needed localhost socket binding and log writes under `~/.gemini/antigravity-cli/`; session state, crash output, and OAuth refresh may need additional writes in that tree. Do not assume an API key or log redirection removes these requirements. Respect the host's filesystem/network policy and report missing access. Do not change global permissions or automatically retry with broader access. Use interactive sign-in outside the headless call when authentication is missing.

If the result reports `installed: false`, suggest installing agy with `curl -fsSL https://antigravity.google/cli/install.sh | bash` or `brew install --cask antigravity-cli`. If `authenticated: false`, suggest running `agy` interactively to sign in.

## Model selection

Reviews and rescue runs default to the model currently selected in the agy TUI (`/model` picker). Pass `--model "<display name>"` to any subcommand to override per call — valid names come from `agy models` (e.g. `Gemini 3.5 Flash (Low)`); they contain spaces, so quote them.

## Backgrounding

The companion is stateless and synchronous; it does not manage background jobs. Claude Code can supply its own background facility. In Codex, run in the foreground and poll the same shell session until it exits. Consume `--wait`; report `--background` as unsupported before launching rather than silently substituting foreground execution.

## What this skill is NOT

- **Not a slash-command surface.** Skills are model-invoked; for `/ask-antigravity:review`-style UX, install the ask-antigravity *plugin* into Claude Code instead.
- **Not stateful.** No transcripts, no session resume, no PID tracking. Every invocation is a fresh one-shot agy call.
- **Not a guaranteed sandbox.** `review` and `adversarial-review` include the whole diff in the prompt and run agy in a temporary working directory. Changing directories does not restrict filesystem access; host policy must enforce any required boundary. But `task` runs agy **in the repo**, and omitting `--write` does *not* stop it from editing files — on agy 1.1.1 no CLI flag does (verified: omitting `--dangerously-skip-permissions`, `--mode plan`, and `--sandbox` all still wrote). `--write` signals intent and auto-approves prompts; it is not a capability boundary. Run `task` on a clean git tree so any change is visible in `git diff`.
